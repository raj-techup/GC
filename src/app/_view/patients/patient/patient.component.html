      <p>Laboratory results are required for making a large proportion of medical decisions. In developed countries, an estimated 60% to 80% of patient management decisions are based on laboratory data. Laboratory investigations are often more sensitive and specific than clinical decision criteria alone.Diagnostics and clinical patient management have an interdependent relationship; laboratory data provide justification for clinical decision making, while clinical signs or the clinical management protocol often prompt laboratory testing. For example, during the management of HIV infection, poor performance of tests at any stage of the care and treatment continuum (i.e., diagnosis, disease staging, treatment initiation, the monitoring of drug efficacy and toxic effects) can reduce the effectiveness of treatment and deny appropriate care to patients in need by impeding the path of patients along the continuum. Without a reliable diagnosis, patients will not receive most HIV-related services for treatment or prevention. Without an accurate CD4 cell count, many patients cannot have their disease correctly staged, which could prevent them from accessing lifesaving antiretroviral drugs before the onset of serious illness. Once a patient is receiving therapy, ongoing CD4, clinical chemistry, hematology, and, in some settings, viral load tests provide clinicians with necessary information on the safety and efficacy of the drugs. If these tests are not available or are inaccurate, treatment outcomes for patients are likely to be poorer, with higher mortality and more frequent illness.16,17 Reliable laboratory testing is needed, or the scale-up of treatment programs may be retarded and their long-term effectiveness and sustainability reduced.</p>
